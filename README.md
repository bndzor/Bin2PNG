# Bin2PNG

WIP In Progress. Its modified for Linux from Leeroy Brun source. Thanks Leeroy :)

Convert a binary file to a PNG image and then decrypt it back to binary.

## Binary to PNG :

Each bytes of the binary file are converted to numbers (0-255), which will then define a pixel color.
For each bytes will be a grayscale pixel in the final PNG image. 
The PNG image can have more pixels than the number of bytes of the binary file. 
The excess pixels will have a RGB(255, 0, 0) color (red) and will be ignored when decrypting the file.

## PNG to Binary :

When decrypting the PNG file to create the corresponding binary file, we take each pixels of the image and get their color.
If the R & G color are different, we skip this pixel. It is not at grayscale, and so is an excess pixel.
If it is grayscale, we take the color number for R and then convert it to it's binary representation.
We construct an unsigned char array with all decrypted binary data of pixels and then save it back to a binary file.

## Usage :

You can download the exe file directly from here : https://github.com/leeroybrun/Bin2PNG/releases/download/v1.1/Bin2PNG.exe

Or you can build it with Visual Studio or any other C compiler.

Then place your binary file to transform in the same folder as the `Bin2PNG.exe` file, and rename it to `in.exe`.

You can then encrypt it to a PNG image :

```shell
Bin2PNG.exe encrypt
```

If successfull, it will then generate an `image.png` file.

You can then decrypt this file back to a binary like this :

```shell
Bin2PNG.exe decrypt
```

It will decrypt the `image.png` file and create a new binary `out.exe`.

## Todo :

- Add parameters to define the name of the binary and image files
- Maybe find a better way to convert byte to number
- Find why the decrypted exe is a bit larger than the original
